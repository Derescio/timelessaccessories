# üéØ Promotion System Testing Checklist

## Updates (2024-06)
- **Per-User Limit:** Promotions can now have a per-user limit (`perUserLimit`). This restricts how many times a user (by account or guest email) can use a code.
- **Guest Email Enforcement:** Guests must enter an email to use promo codes. Usage is tracked by email.
- **Promo Code Persistence:** Promo codes are **not** auto-applied to new carts. After an order is placed or the cart is emptied, all applied promotions are cleared.
- **Cart Filtering:** If a guest has used a promo code up to their per-user limit, it will not be shown as applied in the cart for new items.

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test cases for the promotion/coupon system. Use this checklist to ensure all promotion features work correctly across different scenarios.

## üöÄ Quick Setup
1. Run the test data script: `node scripts/create-promotion-test-cases.js`
2. Ensure you have products in your cart for testing
3. Test both as guest user and authenticated user
