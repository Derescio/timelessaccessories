# Promotion System Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for the database-first promotion persistence system. It covers both authenticated and guest user flows, ensuring the system works correctly across all scenarios.

## Prerequisites

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Database**: Ensure you have a clean test database
2. **Promotions**: Create test promotions via admin panel
3. **Products**: Ensure you have products with inventory
4. **Payment Methods**: Configure test payment methods (Stripe test mode, PayPal sandbox)

### Test Promotion Codes
Create these test promotions in your admin panel:

```sql
-- Test Promotion 1: Percentage Discount
INSERT INTO "Promotion" (
  id, name, "promotionType", value, "startDate", "endDate", 
  "couponCode", "isActive", "usageLimit", "applyToAllItems"
) VALUES (
  'test-promo-1', 'Test 20% Off', 'PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT', 20, 
  '2024-01-01', '2025-12-31', 'TEST20', true, 100, true
);

-- Test Promotion 2: Fixed Amount Discount  
INSERT INTO "Promotion" (
  id, name, "promotionType", value, "startDate", "endDate",
  "couponCode", "isActive", "usageLimit", "applyToAllItems"
) VALUES (
  'test-promo-2', 'Test $10 Off', 'FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT', 10,
  '2024-01-01', '2025-12-31', 'SAVE10', true, 50, true
);

-- Test Promotion 3: Limited Use
INSERT INTO "Promotion" (
  id, name, "promotionType", value, "startDate", "endDate",
  "couponCode", "isActive", "usageLimit", "applyToAllItems"
) VALUES (
  'test-promo-3', 'Limited Use 15% Off', 'PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT', 15,
  '2024-01-01', '2025-12-31', 'LIMITED15', true, 1, true
);
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Promotion doesn't persist to shipping page
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check if cart promotion exists
SELECT * FROM "CartPromotion" WHERE "cartId" = 'your-cart-id';
```
**Solution**: Verify `useCartPromotions` hook is using `cartData` parameter

#### Issue: Order created without promotion data
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check recent orders
SELECT id, "appliedPromotionId", "discountAmount" 
FROM "Order" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5;
```
**Solution**: Verify order creation passes `appliedPromotion` data

#### Issue: Promotion usage not recorded
**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check if webhook processed
SELECT * FROM "PromotionUsage" 
WHERE "orderId" = 'your-order-id';
```
**Solution**: Check webhook logs and `recordPromotionUsage` function

#### Issue: Email not sent
**Diagnosis**: Check email service configuration and webhook logs
**Solution**: Verify `sendOrderConfirmationEmail` is called in webhooks

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Concurrent Promotion Applications
1. **Simulate 10+ users** applying same promotion simultaneously
2. **Verify no race conditions** in promotion application
3. **Check database consistency**

#### Scenario 2: High-Volume Checkout
1. **Process multiple orders** with promotions quickly
2. **Verify webhook processing** handles load
3. **Monitor database performance**

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing, clean up test data:

```sql
-- Clean up test orders and related data
DELETE FROM "PromotionUsage" WHERE "promotionId" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "Promotion" WHERE "couponCode" LIKE 'TEST%'
);

DELETE FROM "OrderItem" WHERE "orderId" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "Order" WHERE "appliedPromotionId" IN (
    SELECT id FROM "Promotion" WHERE "couponCode" LIKE 'TEST%'
  )
);

DELETE FROM "Order" WHERE "appliedPromotionId" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "Promotion" WHERE "couponCode" LIKE 'TEST%'
);

DELETE FROM "CartPromotion" WHERE "promotionId" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "Promotion" WHERE "couponCode" LIKE 'TEST%'
);

-- Reset promotion usage counts
UPDATE "Promotion" SET "usageCount" = 0 
WHERE "couponCode" LIKE 'TEST%';
```
