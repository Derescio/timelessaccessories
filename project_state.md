   - Location: `app/(root)/shipping/page.tsx`

### Form Validation and Data Handling
1. **Shipping Form Validation**
   - Issue: Form validation messages not displaying correctly
   - Fix: Removed Zod validation in favor of direct field validation with specific error messages
   - Status: Fixed
   - Location: `app/(root)/shipping/page.tsx`

2. **Market-Specific Validation**
   - Issue: Validation handling inconsistent between LASCO and GLOBAL markets
   - Fix: Implemented separate validation logic for each market type

3. **Form Data Persistence**
   - Issue: Country field not auto-populating correctly
   - Fix: Updated address handling to properly populate country field based on market type
   - Status: Fixed
   - Location: `app/(root)/shipping/page.tsx`

### Type Safety and Code Organization
1. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Issue: 'any' type usage in PaymentDataWithResult interface
   - Fix: Replaced 'any' with Record<string, unknown> for better type safety
   - Status: Fixed
   - Location: `lib/actions/payment.actions.ts`

2. **Unused Interfaces**
   - Issue: PaymentRequest interface defined but never used
   - Fix: Removed unused interface
   - Status: Fixed
   - Location: `lib/actions/payment.actions.ts`

3. **Payment Types Organization**
   - Issue: Payment-related types scattered across files
   - Fix: Created dedicated types/payment.ts file for better organization
   - Status: Fixed
   - Location: `types/payment.ts`

### Component Props and State Management
1. **LascoPayButton Props**
   - Issue: Unnecessary props in LascoPayButton component
   - Fix: Simplified props interface to only include onClick and disabled
   - Status: Fixed
   - Location: `components/checkout/LascoPayButton.tsx`

2. **State Management Optimization**
   - Issue: Unused state variables in shipping form
