# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Timeless Accessories e-commerce project.

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of four main stages:
1. Validation
2. Build
3. Staging Deployment
4. Production Deployment

## Pipeline Triggers

The pipeline is triggered on:
- Push events to `main` and `development` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` and `development` branches

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Validation Stage
```yaml
validate:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
This stage includes:
- **Environment Setup**: 
  - Node.js 18.x
  - PostgreSQL database service
- **Validation Steps**:
  - Dependencies installation
  - Linting checks
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Unit tests execution

### 2. Build Stage
```yaml
build:
  needs: validate
```
This stage includes:
- Fresh checkout of code
- Dependencies installation
- Application build process
- Build artifact generation

### 3. Staging Deployment (Development Branch)
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  needs: build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/development'
```
- Triggered only for the development branch
- Deploys to Vercel preview environment
- Uses staging environment variables
- Requires successful build stage

### 4. Production Deployment (Main Branch)
```yaml
deploy-production:
  needs: build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```
- Triggered only for the main branch
- Deploys to Vercel production environment
- Uses production environment variables
- Requires successful build stage
- Manual approval required

## Environment Variables

### Build and Test
- `NODE_VERSION`: 18.x
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Database user
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

### Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel deployment token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Vercel project ID

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Requires pull request before merging
- Requires CI checks to pass
- Requires code review approval
- No direct pushes allowed

### Development Branch
- Requires CI checks to pass
- Requires code review approval
- Allows direct pushes for urgent fixes

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
1. Push changes to development branch
2. Automatic CI/CD pipeline trigger
3. Validation and build stages run
4. Automatic deployment to Vercel preview environment
5. Preview URL generated for testing

### Production Deployment
1. Create pull request from development to main
2. CI/CD pipeline runs on PR
3. Code review and approval required
4. Merge PR to main branch
5. Production deployment pipeline triggers
6. Manual approval step
7. Deployment to Vercel production environment

## Monitoring and Rollback

### Monitoring
- Vercel deployment logs
- GitHub Actions workflow logs
- Application error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### Rollback Procedure
1. Access Vercel dashboard
2. Locate previous successful deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"
4. Verify rollback success

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**
   ```
   type(scope): subject
   
   [optional body]
   [optional footer]
   ```
   Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

2. **Branch Naming**
   - Feature branches: `feature/description`
   - Bug fixes: `bugfix/description`
   - Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Use PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Include testing instructions
   - Add relevant labels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Failed Tests**
   - Check test logs
   - Run tests locally
   - Verify database connection

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check dependency versions
   - Verify environment variables
   - Review build logs

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Verify Vercel tokens
   - Check environment variables
   - Review deployment logs

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Stored as GitHub Secrets
   - Never exposed in logs
   - Rotated regularly

2. **Access Control**
   - Limited deployment permissions
   - Protected branch settings
   - Required reviews

3. **Code Scanning**
   - Dependency vulnerability checks
   - Code quality checks
   - Security linting
