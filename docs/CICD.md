# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Timeless Accessories e-commerce project.

## Overview
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD, integrated with Vercel for deployments and Neon PostgreSQL for database management. The pipeline supports multiple environments with database branching for isolation and safety.

## Pipeline Structure

### Environments
1. **Development**
   - Local development environment
   - Individual database branches for feature development

2. **Staging**
   - Automated deployments from `development` branch
   - Dynamic database branches for testing
   - Preview deployments on Vercel

3. **Production**
   - Deployments from `main` branch
   - Main database branch
   - Production environment on Vercel

## Pipeline Triggers

The pipeline is triggered on:
- Push events to `main` and `development` branches
- Pull requests targeting `main` and `development` branches

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Validation
```yaml
validate:
  steps:
    - Code checkout
    - Node.js setup
    - Dependencies installation
    - Environment setup
    - Database migration check
    - Type checking
    - Linting
    - Testing
```

### 2. Staging Deployment
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  needs: validate
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/development'
  steps:
    - Create staging database branch
    - Deploy to Vercel preview
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```yaml
deploy-production:
  needs: validate
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - Create backup snapshot
    - Deploy to Vercel production
```

## Database Management

### Branch Strategy
- **Production**: Main branch
- **Staging**: `staging-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}`
- **PR Testing**: `pr-{PR_NUMBER}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}`
- **Snapshots**: `deploy-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}`

### Migration Handling
```yaml
- name: Run Prisma Migrations
  run: |
    if [[ $GITHUB_REF == refs/heads/main ]]; then
      echo "Running production migrations..."
      npx prisma migrate deploy
    else
      echo "Running migrations on branch..."
      npx prisma migrate deploy
    fi
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Secrets
```yaml
# Vercel
VERCEL_TOKEN: "Vercel deployment token"
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: "Project ID from Vercel"
VERCEL_ORG_ID: "Organization ID from Vercel"

# Database
DATABASE_URL: "Neon PostgreSQL connection string"
```

### Environment Variables
```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '20.x'
  NEON_DB_NAME: 'dwshop'
  NEON_PROJECT_ID: 'dark-scene-a59y6uw3'
```

## Deployment Process

### Pull Request
1. Creates temporary database branch
2. Runs validation suite
3. Creates preview deployment

### Staging
1. Creates new staging database branch
2. Runs migrations
3. Deploys to staging environment

### Production
1. Creates backup snapshot
2. Runs migrations on main branch
3. Deploys to production

## Safety Measures

### Database
- Automatic branching for isolation
- Pre-deployment snapshots
- Migration status checks

### Deployment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Required status checks
- Protected branches

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Database Branches
- Regular cleanup of old branches
- Monitoring of branch usage
- Snapshot management

### Deployments
- Vercel deployment logs
- GitHub Actions logs
- Database migration history

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Failed Migrations**
   - Check migration history
   - Verify database access
   - Review branch status

2. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check Vercel logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Review build output

3. **Branch Issues**
   - Confirm branch exists
   - Check permissions
   - Verify connection string

## Best Practices

1. **Development**
   - Create feature branches
   - Test migrations locally
   - Use meaningful commit messages

2. **Deployment**
   - Review changes before merge
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Verify environment variables

3. **Database**
   - Regular branch cleanup
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Maintain backup snapshots

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Requires pull request before merging
- Requires CI checks to pass
- Requires code review approval
- No direct pushes allowed

### Development Branch
- Requires CI checks to pass
- Requires code review approval
- Allows direct pushes for urgent fixes

## Monitoring and Rollback

### Monitoring
- Vercel deployment logs
- GitHub Actions workflow logs
- Application error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### Rollback Procedure
1. Access Vercel dashboard
2. Locate previous successful deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"
4. Verify rollback success

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Stored as GitHub Secrets
   - Never exposed in logs
   - Rotated regularly

2. **Access Control**
   - Limited deployment permissions
   - Protected branch settings
   - Required reviews

3. **Code Scanning**
   - Dependency vulnerability checks
   - Code quality checks
   - Security linting
