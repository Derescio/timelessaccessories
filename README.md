## Payment Integrations

### Stripe Setup

The application uses Stripe for credit card payments. To set up Stripe:

1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. Set the following environment variables:

   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

4. For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/STRIPE_SETUP.md](docs/STRIPE_SETUP.md)

#### Stripe Debugging

For development and testing purposes, you can use the built-in debugging utility:

```javascript
// In browser console (development mode only)
import { debugStripePaymentIntent } from "@/lib/utils";
debugStripePaymentIntent("order-id-here");
```

This will output detailed information about the Stripe payment intent creation process in the browser console.

Alternatively, you can use the provided debug script:

```javascript
// Load the debug script in the browser console
fetch('/debug-scripts/test-stripe.js')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(text => eval(text))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed to load debug script:', error));

// Then test Stripe payment with an order ID
testStripePayment("order-id-here");
```

This script makes a direct request to the Stripe payment API and logs detailed response information.

You can also visit `/debug-scripts/stripe-tester.html` in your development environment to use a visual interface for testing Stripe payment intents.

### PayPal Setup

For PayPal payment processing:

1. Create a PayPal Developer account
2. Set up a sandbox application
3. Configure the environment variables:

   ```
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=...
   PAYPAL_APP_SECRET=...
   PAYPAL_API_URL=https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=...
   ```

## Market Configuration

This application supports two different market configurations:

### 1. GLOBAL Market

# Run the market switcher tool
npm run switch-market
```

This will update the `.env` file with the selected market configuration. Remember to restart your development server after switching markets for the changes to take effect.

## Category Management System

The category management system allows admins to create, edit, and organize product categories in a hierarchical structure.

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Categories**: Categories can have parent-child relationships, allowing for nested organization
- **Validation**: The system prevents circular references (cannot set a category as its own parent or as a descendant)
- **User Association**: Categories are associated with the admin user who creates or updates them
- **Image Management**: Categories can have images uploaded through UploadThing

### Recent Improvements

- Fixed issue with category updates when maintaining the same parent
- Added proper validation to prevent circular references
- Added user tracking for category ownership
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive logging for easier troubleshooting

### Common Operations

1. **Creating a category**: Navigate to Admin > Categories > Create Category
2. **Editing a category**: Select any category from the list and click Edit
3. **Creating a subcategory**: Either select a parent when creating a new category, or use the "Add Subcategory" option
4. **Deleting a category**: Categories can only be deleted if they have no subcategories or products
